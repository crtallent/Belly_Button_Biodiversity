# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Overview of Belly_Button_Biodiversity Project

For this task, a leading company, Improbable Beef, is looking to find a non-meat based microbe that will produce a flavor similar to beef for its plant-based meat product.  It is theorized that this flavor component may be found in the navel of human beings.  Improbable Beef is looking for participants as they work on isolating the microbes that will produce the desired flavor.  An interactive series of charts have been built to help participants identify the species of bacteria that are found in their navel, specifically the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units, or OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) and Otu Clustering 2022). 

The interactive charts can be assessed [here](https://crtallent.github.io/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/).
